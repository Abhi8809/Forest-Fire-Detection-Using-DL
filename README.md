# Forest-Fire-Detection-Using-DL
Forest fires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human lives. Early detection is crucial for effective firefighting and minimizing damage. Deep Learning (DL) techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have emerged as powerful tools for automating the detection of forest fires using dl
